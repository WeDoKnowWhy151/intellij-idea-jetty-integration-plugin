This is the Jetty Integration Plug-in for IntelliJ IDEA.  It allows
configuration and use of the Jetty webserver directly from IntelliJ IDEA,
for running/debugging web applications.

The 'master' git branch is used for development against the current IDEA
development tree.  There are other branches for IDEA versions 6, 7, 8 and
9 (although no further development for IDEA 6, 7 or 8 is envisaged).

The IDEA project files may or may not be useful to you.  If you're familiar
with IDEA plug-in development then you'll doubtless be able to figure out
what you might need to change.  The project files were created with IDEA
9.0.3.
